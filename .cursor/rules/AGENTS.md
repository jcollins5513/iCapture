Principal Architect

Lock scope to on‑device pipeline. Reject cloud creep.

Keep API surfaces minimal. Approve public types and module boundaries.

Check that triggers are deterministic and debounced.

iOS Engineer

Own AVFoundation stack and SwiftUI UI.

Guarantee main‑thread UI and background camera queues separation.

Enforce folder structure and file naming.

ML/Computer Vision Engineer

Implement optical‑flow + ROI occupancy heuristics.

Tune ε, τ, and debounce empirically. Provide test harness with recorded frames.

Add fallback to interval‑only if flow is unstable.

QA Engineer

Build test matrix (lighting × vehicle class × trigger mode).

Automate smoke with XCUITest where applicable (UI only; camera mocked).

Build/Tooling

Keep lint at zero warnings.

Ensure Scripts/build.sh green before merges.

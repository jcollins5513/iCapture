-always Run swiftlint and commit changes

- Provide a clean cursor-ready prompt I can use at the start of my next conversation.
- The prompt should be included in the start-of-session.md file.
  - Reference the updated section of `granular-plan.md`
  - Continue work on that part of the project
  - Be formatted clearly for direct reuse

This will close the current conversation, preserve all context, and fully prepare the workspace for the next one.

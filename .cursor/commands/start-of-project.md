# ðŸš€ Cursor Start of Project Prompt

You are assisting on iCapture. Respect master-plan.md. Only modify code under iCapture/**. Keep trigger logic simple: ROI occupancy + interval/stop. Never add cloud calls. If uncertain, prefer simpler heuristic.

## ðŸ§­ Instructions to Cursor

### Step 1: Look for 'master-plan.md Create the `master-plan.md`
- This file will act as the high-level roadmap.
- It must not be changed after creation unless I explicitly instruct you to.
- It defines the core features and structure of the project.

### Step 2: Generate `granular-plan.md`
- Based strictly on the `master-plan.md`.
- Break each task into actionable, detailed steps.
- Use this to track progress of the project.
- Update it only at the end of the session by checking off completed tasks.
- Do not modify `master-plan.md` when checking off granular items.
- The xcode project has already been created in xcode and is nested

- Next focus: Begin Milestone 6 - Video Recording Toggle During Rotation

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Complete task 6.1: Add video recording toggle UI
2. Complete task 6.2: Implement AVFoundation video capture
3. Complete task 6.3: Configure 1080p30 H.264 encoding
4. Complete task 6.4: Add video file naming (turn.MOV)
5. Complete task 6.5: Implement video start/stop with rotation
6. Complete task 6.6: Add video metadata to session JSON
7. Complete task 6.7: Test video recording during vehicle rotation

**Project Context:**
- Hands-free vehicle photo capture app for iPhone 15 Pro+
- ROI-based trigger system (interval + stop detection)
- All processing on-device, no cloud dependencies
- SwiftUI + AVFoundation architecture
- Authentication gate with mock auth system
- Interactive frame box with drag/resize functionality
- Setup wizard with test shot capability
- Git repository with quality gates and pre-commit hooks
- ROI occupancy detection with background learning
- Interval capture system with 5s timer and debounce
- Visual, haptic, and audio capture feedback
- Motion detection with optical flow and stop detection
- Complete stop-based capture system with debounce

**Development Rules:**
- Respect master-plan.md as single source of truth
- Keep trigger logic simple: ROI occupancy + interval/stop
- Never add cloud calls, everything on-device
- Update granular-plan.md by checking off completed tasks
- Run `./Scripts/Scripts:precommit.sh` before commits
- Use Git workflow: feature branches, quality gates, standardized commits

**Demo Credentials:**
- admin / password123 (Administrator)
- demo / demo123 (Demo User)
- test / test123 (Test User)

**Git Status:**
- Repository: Clean working tree, all linting issues resolved
- Pre-commit hooks: Active (linting + build validation)
- Branch: main (ready for feature/milestone5)
- SwiftLint: 0 violations across all 12 Swift files

**Ready to begin Milestone 6: Video Recording Toggle During Rotation!**

---

**TLDR/Previous Session:**
Completed Milestone 5 with full session storage and asset management system. Implemented VehicleSession and CaptureAsset data models with comprehensive metadata tracking. Created SessionManager with automatic folder structure creation (/Documents/Captures/<STOCK_ID>/ with photos/ and video/ subdirectories). Added StockNumberInputView UI for session creation with validation. Integrated session management with CameraManager for automatic asset tracking and export bundle creation. Enhanced CameraView with session status display and controls. All code compiles successfully with 0 SwiftLint violations. Ready for Milestone 6: Video Recording Toggle During Rotation.

This is where the prompt to start the session should be placed after each session. Put the most recent prompt at the top and move the previous one down with TLDR/

Continue development on iCapture project.

**Current Status:**
- Milestone 1: Project Bootstrap + Toolchain Pass - 8/8 tasks completed ✅
- Milestone 2: Camera Preview + Frame Box Overlay - 3/8 tasks completed
- Authentication gate: ✅ Basic mock auth implemented
- Next focus: Continue Milestone 2 - Make frame box draggable/resizable (task 2.4)

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Complete task 2.4: Make frame box draggable/resizable (partially implemented)
2. Complete task 2.5: Add visual feedback for frame box interaction
3. Complete task 2.6: Implement frame box persistence (UserDefaults) ✅
4. Complete task 2.7: Add setup wizard for frame box positioning
5. Complete task 2.8: Create test shot functionality

**Project Context:**
- Hands-free vehicle photo capture app for iPhone 15 Pro+
- ROI-based trigger system (interval + stop detection)
- All processing on-device, no cloud dependencies
- SwiftUI + AVFoundation architecture
- Authentication gate now implemented with mock auth
- Camera permissions already configured

**Key Files:**
- `Docs/granular-plan.md` - Detailed implementation roadmap
- `Docs/master-plan.md` - Project specifications
- `iCapture/ContentView.swift` - Main UI router (auth gate)
- `iCapture/UI/AuthView.swift` - Authentication interface
- `iCapture/UI/CameraView.swift` - Camera functionality
- `iCapture/Core/AuthManager.swift` - Authentication state management
- `iCapture/Core/CameraManager.swift` - AVFoundation camera control
- `iCapture/UI/FrameBoxOverlay.swift` - ROI selection component

**Development Rules:**
- Respect master-plan.md as single source of truth
- Keep trigger logic simple: ROI occupancy + interval/stop
- Never add cloud calls, everything on-device
- Update granular-plan.md by checking off completed tasks
- Run `./Scripts/Scripts:precommit.sh` before commits

**Demo Credentials:**
- admin / password123 (Administrator)
- demo / demo123 (Demo User)
- test / test123 (Test User)

**Ready to continue with frame box interaction improvements!**
